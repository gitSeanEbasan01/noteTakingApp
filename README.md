## Short Walkthrough
### Adding a canvas and a note.
- Click the Add Canvas button on the left panel to add a canvas inside the Canvas List.
- And inside the Canvas you created, you can add a Note Card by clicking on the square button just beside the left panel.
- Double click on the Note Card to open its editor and add some notes.

### Creating A Linked Word Button
- Put an "_" underscore beside a word (e.g. _WordButton) and press ctrl/cmd + Enter. This will create a button that creates another Note Card connected to the current card you're in when you click it.

## Developer's Notes
The app is currently full of bugs and lacks a lot of features to be considered a full application.
The bugs will soon be fixed and will continue adding more features later on for I'm currently working on Full Stack Development. I might forget to continue this project but will see.
